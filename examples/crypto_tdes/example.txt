* The Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) is compliant with the American 
* FIPS Publication 46-3 specification. The TDES supports the four different 
* confidentiality modes of operation (ECB, CBC, OFB and CFB), specified in  
* the FIPS and is compatible with the Peripheral Data Controller channels   
* for all of these modes, minimizing processor intervention for large buffer
* transfers.
