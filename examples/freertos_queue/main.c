/**
 *  \page FreeRTOS-queue FreeRTOS queue with sama5dx Microcontrollers
 *
 *  \section Purpose
 *
 *  The FreeRTOS queue example will help new users get familiar with Atmel's
 *  sama5dx microcontroller and FreeRTOS. This basic application shows the startup
 *  sequence of a chip and how to use its core peripherals and FreeRTOS basic API.
 *
 *  \section Requirements
 *
 *  This package can be used with SAMA5DX board.
 *
 *  \section Description
 *
 * The demonstration program makes one LED on the board blink at a fixed rate.
 * This program create two task: one send data, another receive. Data is shared by
 * these two task through queue, which control the led blink rate.
 *
 *
 *  \section Usage
 *
 *  -# Build the program and download it inside the evaluation board. Please
 *     refer to the
 *     <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/6421B.pdf">
 *     SAM-BA User Guide</a>, the
 *     <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc6310.pdf">
 *     GNU-Based Software Development</a>
 *     application note or to the
 *     <a href="ftp://ftp.iar.se/WWWfiles/arm/Guides/EWARM_UserGuide.ENU.pdf">
 *     IAR EWARM User Guide</a>,
 *     depending on your chosen solution.
 *  -# On the computer, open and configure a terminal application
 *     (e.g. HyperTerminal on Microsoft Windows) with these settings:
 *    - 115200 bauds
 *    - 8 bits of data
 *    - No parity
 *    - 1 stop bit
 *    - No flow control
 *  -# Start the application.
 *  -# One LED should start blinking on the board. In the terminal window, the
 *     following text should appear (values depend on the board and chip used):
 *     \code
 *      -- FreeRTOS Queue Usage Demo Example xxx --
 *      -- SAMxxxxx-xx
 *      -- Compiled: xxx xx xxxx xx:xx:xx --
 *     \endcode
