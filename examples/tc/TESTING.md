TC_CAPTURE_WAVEFORM EXAMPLE
===========================

# Objectives
------------
This example aims to test the TC capture peripheral.

# Example Description
---------------------
This example shows how to configure TC in waveform and capture mode.
In capture mode, pulse signal is set as an input, RA and RB will be loaded when
programmed event occurs. When TC interrupt happens, we could read RA and RB
value for calculating pulse frequency and pulse number be increased. The current
pulse frequency and total pulse number is output on DBGU.

The code can be roughly broken down as follows:
 - Select pre-defined waveform frequency and duty cycle to be generated.
 - Configure TC channel 1 as waveform output.
 - Configure TC channel 2 as capture input.
 - Configure capture Register A be loaded when rising edge of TIOA occurs.
 - Configure capture Register B be loaded when failing edge of TIOA occurs.
 - Configure an interrupt for TC and enable the RB load interrupt.
 - 'c' start capture.
 - 's' will stop capture,and dump the informations what have been captured.

## Setup
--------
On the computer, open and configure a terminal application
(e.g. HyperTerminal on Microsoft Windows) with these settings:
 - 115200 bauds
 - 8 bits of data
 - No parity
 - 1 stop bit
 - No flow control

board and chip used):
```
-- TC Capture Waveform Example  xxx --
-- SAMxxxxx-xx
-- Compiled: xxx xx xxxx xx:xx:xx --
```

```
