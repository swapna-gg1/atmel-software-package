  The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is compliant with the American FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) Publication 197 specification. AES supports all five confidentiality modes of operation for symmetrical key block cipher algorithms (ECB,CBC,OFB, CFB and CTR), as specified in the NIST Special Publication 80038A. It is compatible with all these modes via Peripheral DMA Controller channels, minimizing processor intervention for large buffer transfers.The 128-bit/192-bit/256-bit key is storedin four/six/eight 32-bit registers (AES_KEYWRx) which are all write-only .......................................................
