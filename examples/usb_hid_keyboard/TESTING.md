## Supported targets
--------------------
* SAM9XX5-EK
* SAM9X60-EK
* SAMA5D2-PTC-EK
* SAMA5D2-XPLAINED
* SAMA5D27-SOM1-EK
* SAMA5D3-EK
* SAMA5D3-XPLAINED
* SAMA5D4-EK
* SAMA5D4-XPLAINED
* SAME70-XPLAINED
* SAMV71-XPLAINED

## Setup
--------
On the computer, open and configure a terminal application (e.g. HyperTerminal
on Microsoft Windows) with these settings:
 - 115200 bauds
 - 8 bits of data
 - No parity
 - 1 stop bit
 - No flow control

## Start the application
------------------------

In the terminal window, the following text should appear (values depend on the
board and chip used):
```

 -- Compiled: xxx xx xxxx xx:xx:xx --
 -- : DBG key 1 2 used as buttons
 -- : 1st press to push, 2nd press to release
```

Tested with IAR and GCC (sram and ddram configuration)
