GETTING_STARTED EXAMPLE
============

# Objectives
------------
This example aims to shows basic use of I/O, system initialization and timers.

# Example Description
---------------------
The demonstration program makes two LEDs on the board blink at a fixed rate.
This rate is generated by using Time tick timer. The blinking can be stopped
using two buttons (one for each LED). If there is no enough buttons on board,
please type "1" or "2" in the terminal application on PC to control the LEDs
instead.

# Test
------
## Supported targets
--------------------
* SAM9XX5-EK
* SAM9X60-EK
* SAMA5D2-XPLAINED
* SAMA5D27-SOM1-EK
* SAMA5D2-PTC-EK
* SAMA5D3-EK
* SAMA5D3-XPLAINED
* SAMA5D4-EK
* SAMA5D4-XPLAINED
* SAME70-XPLAINED
* SAMV71-XPLAINED

## Setup
--------
On the computer, open and configure a terminal application
(e.g. HyperTerminal on Microsoft Windows) with these settings:
 - 115200 bauds
 - 8 bits of data
 - No parity
 - 1 stop bit
 - No flow control

## Start the application
------------------------

Two/three LEDs should start blinking on the board. In the terminal window, "0 1 2 0 1 2 ..."

Tested with IAR and GCC (sram and ddram configuration)

In order to test this example, the process is the following:
